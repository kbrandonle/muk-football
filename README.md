# Fantasy Football App

This is what I have so far.
What you need to run it:

- [Node] (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (this will also install npm, along with Node)
- Nodemon - npm install --save-dev nodemon (you can also do npm install -g nodemon for global install)

After you clone, run 'npm i'.
Once dependencies are installed, run 'npm build' in the main dircetory AND in the client directory.
Next, run the dev script, 'npm dev', in the main directory.

# Backend Code

The backend is not yet deployed but when it is I will paste the URLs to the endpoints here. You can find the code for the user's API but I will add more services later.
